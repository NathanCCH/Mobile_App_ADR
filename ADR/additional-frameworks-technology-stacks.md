# Additional Frameworks or Technology Stacks

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The mobile app requires real-time location updates, a map interface, and secure payment transactions. The additional frameworks or technology stacks we choose will impact these features.

## Decision
We propose to use Express.js as our web application framework, Socket.IO for real-time communication, and Sequelize as our ORM for database interactions.

## Consequences
These choices will provide a robust and flexible foundation for our app, but will require the team to be familiar with these technologies.
