# UI Framework

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The mobile app needs to provide an intuitive and responsive user interface. The UI framework we choose will impact the user experience and development process.

## Decision
We propose to use React Native as our UI framework. React Native allows us to write code in JavaScript, which can be shared between iOS and Android platforms, increasing development efficiency.

## Consequences
Using React Native will allow us to share a significant portion of our code between different platforms, reducing development time. However, we may need to write native code for some device-specific features or optimizations.
