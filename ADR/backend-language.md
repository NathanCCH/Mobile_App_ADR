# Backend Language

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The mobile app requires a robust and scalable server to handle real-time location updates and secure payment transactions. The backend language we choose will impact these features.

## Decision
We propose to use Node.js as our backend language. Node.js is known for its performance and scalability, and it's JavaScript-based, which allows for code reuse between the frontend and backend.

## Consequences
Choosing Node.js will allow us to use the same language on both the frontend and backend, which can improve development efficiency. However, we'll need to ensure our team has the necessary expertise in Node.js.
